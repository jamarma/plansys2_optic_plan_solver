# Optic Plan Solver
Plan solver for [ROS2 Planning System](https://github.com/IntelligentRoboticsLabs/ros2_planning_system) that uses [OPTIC](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/planning/software/optic.html) for solving PDDL plans.

## Dependencies
Download and compile OPTIC, for more information visit [OPTIC Homepage](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/planning/software/optic.html).

To execute [OPTIC](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/planning/software/optic.html) from any path you must create the following symbolic link where "optic_path" is the path where your executable is located.
~~~
ln -s optic_path optic
